This is the source code for my arduino based rubiks cube solving robot.

I based my robot design on the following link:
https://www.instructables.com/id/Rubiks-Cube-Solver/



Look at the pictures folder for a sample video of my robot.

The rubiksRobot.ino file contains the code for the arduino board,the rubiksSolver.py file contains the code for the a tkinter based gui to enter the state of the cube.
