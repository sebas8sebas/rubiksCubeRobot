This is the source code for my arduino based rubiks cube solving robot.

I based my robot design on <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Rubiks-Cube-Solver/">this </a> link.

Look at the pictures folder for a video of my robot working on the rubiks cube.

The rubiksRobot.ino file contains the code for the arduino board,the rubiksSolver.py file contains the code for the a tkinter based gui to enter the state of the cube.
